# Python_PL_History_Stats
An analysis of Premier League's history written in python.
The analysis shows stats by season and across the complete history of PL. It calculates statistical values of interest for clubs finishing on each season in a specific position, e.g. the number of shots on goal that 4th place of every season had, winning percentage against top 4 clubs - median value, average, etc.

## Installation

To use the program simply download/clone the repository and run the .py code with a python 3.8 interpeter. Make sure to have pandas package installed.
NOTE that the current code is relying on the given folder hierarchy, so make sure not to change any folder name and relative position without correcting the code.

## Usage

Run the code and explore PL stats. I encourage users to use the code as a starting point to more complex analysis.
